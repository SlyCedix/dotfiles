# Hello /r/UnixPorn

Dependencies:  
 * [wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal) - Needed to generate colorschemes
 
This config is heavily based on [Zedjones' configs](https://github.com/Zedjones/desktop-config) and [rintivdorh's polybar](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5y85do/i3gaps_polybar_cranium/) with the added benefit of being able to switch color schemes on the fly with the theme command that I've included.

[Firefox Stylish Theme](https://gist.github.com/SlyCedix/d5ebc2ee9292adedf6f6ce1f41cd4157) - Must change home location at the top of the file
